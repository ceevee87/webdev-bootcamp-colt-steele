# webdev-bootcamp-colt-steele
coding assignments and other experiments related to front/back end web development course on Udemy.

I am starting off with a project that is later in the course called,
YelpCamp. This is my first cut of code (it is not nearly done at all).

Later, I will add in previous assignment as I see fit.
